Three Rings for the elven kings under the sky.
Seven for the dwarfs lords in their halls of stone.
Nine for the mortal men doomed to die.
One for the dark lord on his dark throne.
In the land of Mordor where shadows lie.
One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them,
One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.
- J.R.R Tolkien.
